# California House Price Prediction

In this project you will work on developing an end to end machine learning project using linear regression.

Our main focus will be on extensive data visualization, we will perform data feature engineering, we will also see how we can select features based on the correlation of the features.

We focus very less on model but more on understanding the problem by visualization.

Here is the corelation matrix.
